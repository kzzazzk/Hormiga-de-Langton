Langton's Ant is a simple yet fascinating cellular automaton that provides insight into emergent behavior and complexity from simple rules. This GitHub project is a Langton's Ant simulator implemented in Java, allowing you to explore and experiment with Langton's Ant behavior. You can observe how a single ant, following just a few basic rules, creates complex patterns on a grid.

## Introduction

Langton's Ant, named after its creator Christopher Langton, is a cellular automaton consisting of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: black or white. An "ant" is placed on one of the cells and moves according to a set of simple rules:

1. If the ant is on a white cell, it turns 90 degrees to the right, flips the color of the cell to black, and moves one step forward.
2. If the ant is on a black cell, it turns 90 degrees to the left, flips the color of the cell to white, and moves one step forward.

These seemingly straightforward rules lead to surprising and intricate patterns as the ant continues to move.

## Features

- Simulate Langton's Ant behavior on a grid.
- Adjustable grid size.
- Visualize the grid and ant's movement in real-time.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Langton's Ant simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langtons-ant-simulator.git
2. Run Ejecucion.java

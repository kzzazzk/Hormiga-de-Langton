## Introduction

Langton's Ant, named after its creator Christopher Langton, is a cellular automaton consisting of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: black or white. An "ant" is placed on one of the cells and moves according to a set of simple rules:

1. If the ant is on a white cell, it turns 90 degrees to the right, flips the color of the cell to black, and moves one step forward.
2. If the ant is on a black cell, it turns 90 degrees to the left, flips the color of the cell to white, and moves one step forward.

These seemingly straightforward rules lead to surprising and intricate patterns as the ant continues to move.

## Features

- Simulate Langton's Ant behavior on a grid.
- Adjustable grid size.
- Visualize the grid and ant's movement in real-time.
